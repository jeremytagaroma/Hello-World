# Hello-World
Introduction here in Github!

Ciao! 

I'm Jeremy and I'm not an Italian, I'm a Filipino.
My Surname is 'Tagaroma' means "from Rome", but I'm a Filipino, I repeat I'm a Filipino.

I decided to join here in Github to continue the free courses in Harvard CS50.
I'm a 17 years-old senior high school student pursuing Information and Communication Technology.

Hoping to learn more about coding 'cause I'm worried about my futureðŸ˜­

Arrivederci!
